# Welcome to Integra Smart Contracts

## Real World Contracts (RWC)

Integra provides blockchain infrastructure for tokenizing real-world documents and assets. Our smart contracts enable you to bring legal documents, certificates, agreements, and other important records onto the blockchain with verifiable ownership, privacy controls, and automated workflows.

### The Revolutionary Concept: Blockchain as Global State Machine

Integra uses the **blockchain as a global state machine** to solve the impossible coordination problem: How do millions of parties with different software, security policies, and no trust coordinate contract execution?

**The foundational challenge Integra solves:**

Traditional approach requires shared systems → Cloud collaboration (violates privacy policies) → Point-to-point APIs (N² integration problem) → Manual processes (doesn't scale).

Integra approach uses blockchain as coordination layer → Each party keeps documents private → Register proofs (hashes) on global blockchain → Use shared identifiers (integraHash, processHash) → Any software can read/write global state → Ad hoc coordination across unlimited parties.

**The breakthrough:** Privacy-preserving coordination at planetary scale.

### Privacy-First Architecture

**Core principle:** Public proof of private information

Integra was born from the need to enable document automation when privacy/security policies prohibit document sharing.

### Document-Token Binding

Unlike traditional NFTs that only store metadata, Integra uses a two-layer architecture that permanently binds ERC tokens to real-world documents.

### Document vs Token Ownership

Integra separates document control from economic interests - a critical distinction from traditional NFTs.

### Reserve-Claim Pattern

Tokenize agreements with people who don't have crypto wallets using the reserve-claim pattern.

### ProcessHash Integration

Every Integra function includes a processHash field that correlates blockchain events with off-chain workflows.

### Trust Graph

When parties complete real-world contracts, Integra automatically issues social attestations that build verifiable reputation.

### Resolver Composition

Transform static documents into programmable contracts by attaching resolver services.
