These concepts build on each other - we recommend reading in order:

### 1. Blockchain as Global State Machine

**The revolutionary concept that makes everything possible**

How do millions of parties with different software coordinate contract execution without trust or shared systems?

---

### 2. Privacy-First Architecture

**The foundational philosophy: Public proof of private information**

Why Integra exists: Enable document automation when privacy policies prohibit sharing.

[Read: Privacy-First Architecture →](/developers/02-privacy-first-architecture)

---

### 3. Document-Token Binding

**How standard ERC tokens become verifiable real-world assets**

The two-layer architecture that permanently binds tokens to cryptographically verifiable documents.

---

### 4. Document vs Token Ownership

**The sophisticated dual-ownership model**

Document owners ≠ Token holders. Service providers can facilitate without owning. Tokens represent roles and interests, not just assets.

---

### 5. Reserve-Claim Pattern

**Mainstream blockchain adoption without wallets**

How to tokenize agreements with people who don't have crypto wallets using document-anchored identity.

---

### 6. ProcessHash Integration

**Universal workflow correlation with any software**

Link blockchain events to CRM/ERP/DMS workflows. Integrate with Salesforce, SAP, SharePoint, or any system.

---

### 7. Trust Graph

**Privacy-preserving reputation from blockchain-backed attestations**

Build verifiable trust through counterparty-verified contract completion, with selective disclosure.

---

## Why These Concepts Matter

Together, these seven concepts enable:

- ✅ **Global coordination** across unlimited parties (global state machine)
- ✅ **Privacy preservation** while automating (public proofs of private info)
- ✅ **Verifiable assets** not just metadata (document-token binding)
- ✅ **Sophisticated workflows** with proper separation of concerns (dual ownership)
- ✅ **Mainstream adoption** without crypto expertise (reserve-claim)
- ✅ **Enterprise integration** with any software (processHash)
- ✅ **Decentralized trust** without surveillance (trust graph)
