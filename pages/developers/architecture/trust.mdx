# Trust Principles

## Overview

Trust in traditional systems relies on centralized intermediaries - banks, notaries, certification authorities - to verify claims and enforce agreements. Integra replaces institutional trust with **cryptographic proofs** and **social attestations**, creating a decentralized trust infrastructure.

## Trust Mechanisms

### 1. Cryptographic Proofs

Mathematical certainty replaces institutional promises.

**Digital Signatures:**
```typescript
// Sign a document hash
const signature = await signer.signMessage(documentHash);

// Anyone can verify the signer's identity
const recovered = ethers.utils.verifyMessage(documentHash, signature);
// recovered === signer.address
```

**Benefits:**
- **Unforgeable** - Only private key holder can create valid signatures
- **Non-repudiable** - Cannot deny signing after the fact
- **Verifiable** - Anyone can verify without trusted third party
- **Timestamped** - On-chain registration proves time of signing

### 2. Social Attestations

Network effects create reputation.

**How It Works:**
- Party A works with Party B successfully
- Party B attests to Party A's performance
- Attestation is cryptographically signed and public
- Future parties can verify A's track record

**Example:**
```typescript
// Client attests to contractor's work quality
const attestation = await eas.attest({
  schema: WORK_QUALITY_SCHEMA,
  data: {
    recipient: contractor.address,
    rating: 5,
    projectType: "smart-contract-audit",
    completedOnTime: true,
    wouldHireAgain: true
  }
});
```

### 3. Reputation Graphs

Historical records build trust over time.

**Trust Score Components:**
- Number of successful contracts
- Value of contracts completed
- Attestations from counterparties
- Time in ecosystem
- Dispute resolution history

**Progressive Trust:**
```typescript
const trustScore = await calculateTrustScore(address);

// New user: Low trust, small contract limits
// trustScore: 10/100, maxContractValue: 1 ETH

// Experienced user: High trust, unlimited
// trustScore: 85/100, maxContractValue: unlimited
```

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

Reveal only what's necessary to establish trust.

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs:**
- Prove you have a credential without revealing it
- Prove you're authorized without revealing why
- Prove you completed a project without revealing details

**Example:**
```typescript
// Prove employment without revealing salary
const proof = await generateProof({
  claim: "employed-at-company-x",
  reveal: ["employer", "duration"],
  hide: ["salary", "title", "performance-reviews"]
});

// Verifier sees: "Employed at Company X for 2 years"
// Verifier doesn't see: Salary, title, reviews, reason for leaving
```

## Trust in Practice

### Scenario 1: First-Time Transaction

Alice (new user) wants to hire Bob (experienced contractor):

1. **Bob's Trust Indicators:**
   - 50 completed contracts
   - 4.8/5.0 average rating
   - 45 positive attestations
   - Member for 2 years
   - Zero disputes

2. **Alice's Protection:**
   - Escrow contract holds payment
   - Milestone-based release
   - Dispute resolution available
   - Bob's reputation at stake

3. **Outcome:**
   - Alice trusts based on Bob's history
   - No intermediary needed
   - Smart contract enforces agreement

### Scenario 2: Building Reputation

Charlie is new to the platform:

**Week 1:**
- Completes 3 small contracts
- Each client attests to completion
- Trust score: 15/100

**Month 3:**
- Completed 25 contracts
- Average rating: 4.7/5.0
- Trust score: 45/100
- Can bid on larger projects

**Year 1:**
- Completed 100+ contracts
- Top-rated in category
- Trust score: 80/100
- Clients seek him out

### Scenario 3: Cross-Organization Trust

Two companies collaborate:

**Company A attests:**
- "Company B delivered project on time"
- "Quality exceeded expectations"
- "Would partner again"

**Company B attests:**
- "Company A paid promptly"
- "Clear communication"
- "Professional relationship"

**Network Effect:**
- Other companies see mutual attestations
- Both companies' trust scores increase
- Future partnerships easier to establish

## Trust vs Traditional Systems

| Traditional | Integra |
|------------|---------|
| Central authority verifies | Cryptographic proof verifies |
| Institution holds reputation | Blockchain holds reputation |
| Platform-specific trust | Portable across platforms |
| Opaque scoring | Transparent on-chain history |
| Can be manipulated | Mathematically sound |
| Expensive intermediaries | Minimal fees |

## Building Trustless Systems

### Smart Contract Escrow

```solidity
// Trustless escrow - no intermediary needed
contract ProjectEscrow {
    address public client;
    address public contractor;
    uint256 public amount;
    bool public approved;

    function releasePayment() external {
        require(msg.sender == client, "Only client can release");
        require(!approved, "Already released");
        approved = true;
        payable(contractor).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

### Multi-Signature Approvals

```solidity
// Require multiple parties to approve
contract MultiSigApproval {
    mapping(address => bool) public signers;
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public approvals;
    uint256 public threshold = 3;

    function approve(bytes32 documentHash) external {
        require(signers[msg.sender], "Not authorized");
        approvals[documentHash]++;
    }

    function isApproved(bytes32 documentHash) public view returns (bool) {
        return approvals[documentHash] >= threshold;
    }
}
```

## Attestation-Based Trust

### Creating Trust Attestations

```typescript
// Client attests to successful project
const attestation = await eas.attest({
  schema: PROJECT_COMPLETION_SCHEMA,
  data: {
    recipient: contractorAddress,
    projectHash: documentHash,
    rating: 5,
    paidAmount: ethers.utils.parseEther("10"),
    completionDate: Date.now(),
    wouldRecommend: true
  }
});
```

### Querying Trust History

```typescript
// Get all attestations for a user
const attestations = await eas.getAttestationsForRecipient(userAddress);

// Filter for work quality
const workAttestations = attestations.filter(
  a => a.schema === WORK_QUALITY_SCHEMA
);

// Calculate average rating
const avgRating = workAttestations.reduce(
  (sum, a) => sum + a.data.rating, 0
) / workAttestations.length;
```

## Best Practices

### For Service Providers

1. **Start Small** - Build reputation with smaller contracts
2. **Deliver Quality** - Each attestation matters
3. **Request Attestations** - Proactively ask satisfied clients
4. **Maintain History** - Don't abandon old addresses
5. **Be Transparent** - Honest disclosure builds trust

### For Clients

1. **Check History** - Review past attestations
2. **Use Escrow** - Protect payments with smart contracts
3. **Attest Fairly** - Accurate attestations help ecosystem
4. **Start with Milestones** - Break large projects into stages
5. **Communicate Clearly** - Prevent misunderstandings

### For Organizations

1. **Build Brand Reputation** - Consistent quality across contracts
2. **Attest to Partners** - Support ecosystem growth
3. **Use Multi-Sig** - Require multiple approvals
4. **Monitor Metrics** - Track trust score and attestations
5. **Resolve Disputes Professionally** - Reputation is valuable

## Trust and Privacy

Trust and privacy work together:

**Public Trust Signals:**
- Number of contracts
- Average ratings
- Time in ecosystem
- Categories of work

**Private Details:**
- Contract specifics
- Payment amounts
- Client identities (if desired)
- Proprietary information

**Example:**
```
Public: "Completed 50 smart contract audits, 4.9/5.0 rating"
Private: Client names, code reviewed, findings, fees
```
