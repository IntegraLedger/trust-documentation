# Identity Principles

## Overview

Identity is the foundation of all interactions in the Integra ecosystem. Unlike traditional systems that rely on centralized identity providers, Integra implements **decentralized, self-sovereign identity** that puts users in control of their digital identity while enabling verifiable credentials and trustless interactions.

## Core Requirements

A robust digital identity system must satisfy four essential properties:

### 1. Persistent

Identity must be **stable across platforms and time**.

**Why It Matters:**
- Reputation and credentials accumulate over time
- Relationships depend on recognizing the same party
- Historical records must remain attributable

**How Integra Achieves It:**
- Ethereum addresses as persistent identifiers
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) tied to blockchain accounts
- Immutable on-chain registration of identity anchors

### 2. Self-Sovereign

Identity must be **controlled by the individual or entity** - not by platforms or intermediaries.

**Why It Matters:**
- Prevent platform lock-in
- User controls what is shared and with whom
- No single point of failure or censorship
- Portability across applications

**How Integra Achieves It:**
- Private key ownership = identity ownership
- User-controlled attestation disclosure
- No central authority can revoke or modify identity
- Compatible with hardware wallets and multi-sig setups

### 3. Verifiable

Identity claims must be **cryptographically provable**.

**Why It Matters:**
- Prevent impersonation and fraud
- Enable trustless verification
- Automate compliance checking
- Support zero-knowledge proofs

**How Integra Achieves It:**
- Digital signatures prove identity ownership
- On-chain attestations from trusted parties
- Cryptographic commitments to identity attributes
- Integration with Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)

### 4. Portable

Identity must be **usable across different systems**.

**Why It Matters:**
- Avoid fragmentation of reputation
- Seamless cross-platform experiences
- Future-proof against platform changes
- Enable composability

**How Integra Achieves It:**
- Standard protocols (EAS, DIDs, Verifiable Credentials)
- Multi-chain support
- Open APIs and SDKs
- Interoperable with other Web3 identity systems

## Identity Architecture

### Root Identity

The **root identity** is the foundational on-chain identifier:

```solidity
// Root identity is simply an Ethereum address
address rootIdentity = 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb;
```

**Properties:**
- Controlled by private key
- Can be an EOA (Externally Owned Account) or smart contract wallet
- Supports multi-sig and social recovery
- Compatible with ENS for human-readable names

### Identity Attestations

**Attestations** add verified attributes to a root identity:

**Types of Attestations:**
1. **Individual Identity**
   - Name (optional, user-controlled disclosure)
   - Professional credentials
   - Educational background
   - Verified social profiles

2. **Organizational Identity**
   - Business registration
   - Tax ID verification
   - Authorized representatives
   - Operating jurisdictions

3. **Credential Attestations**
   - Skills and certifications
   - Work history
   - Project completion
   - Reputation scores

### Privacy-Preserving Identity

Integra uses **selective disclosure** to protect privacy:

```typescript
// User can prove they have a credential without revealing details
const attestation = await eas.getAttestation(attestationId);

// Verify the attestation is valid
const isValid = await eas.verify(attestation);

// User controls what information is shared
const disclosure = {
  hasCredential: true,  // Proven cryptographically
  credentialType: "employment",
  issuer: attestation.attester,
  // Details like salary, start date, etc. NOT revealed
};
```

## Identity in Practice

### Example 1: Individual Professional Identity

Alice wants to prove her work history without revealing sensitive details:

**Setup:**
1. Alice's root identity: `alice.eth` (ENS name → 0x123...)
2. Previous employer attests to employment via EAS
3. Attestation includes hashed credential (not plaintext)

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Alice proves she worked at Company X
const proof = await generateEmploymentProof({
  identity: 'alice.eth',
  employer: 'company-x.eth',
  timeframe: '2020-2023'
});

// New employer verifies without seeing salary, reviews, etc.
const verified = await verifyEmploymentProof(proof);
// Returns: { valid: true, employer: 'company-x.eth', duration: '3 years' }
```

**Privacy Benefits:**
- Salary not disclosed
- Performance reviews not disclosed
- Reason for leaving not disclosed
- Only proves: "Alice worked at Company X for 3 years"

### Example 2: Organizational Identity

Acme Corp wants verifiable business identity:

**Setup:**
1. Root identity: `acme-corp.eth` (controlled by multi-sig)
2. Business registration attestation from jurisdiction
3. Authorized signers attested by organization
4. Operating licenses attested by regulators

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Acme Corp signs a contract
const contract = await integraLedger.registerDocument(
  documentHash,
  metadataURI,
  { from: acmeCorp }
);

// Counterparty verifies Acme Corp's identity
const identity = await getOrganizationIdentity('acme-corp.eth');

// Returns verified attestations:
// - Business registration: ✓
// - Tax ID: ✓
// - Operating license: ✓
// - Authorized signers: [signer1.eth, signer2.eth]
```

### Example 3: Progressive Trust Building

Bob builds reputation through contract completions:

**Phase 1: New to Platform**
- Root identity created
- No attestations yet
- Limited trust score

**Phase 2: First Projects**
- Completes 3 small contracts
- Each client attests to successful completion
- Trust score increases
- Can bid on larger projects

**Phase 3: Established Professional**
- 50+ successful contracts
- Multiple attestations for quality
- High trust score
- Can offer services without upfront payment

```typescript
// Bob's reputation is queryable
const reputation = await getTrustScore('bob.eth');

// Returns:
// {
//   contractsCompleted: 52,
//   successRate: 0.98,
//   totalValue: "150 ETH",
//   topSkills: ["Solidity", "React", "Node.js"],
//   attestations: 48
// }
```

## Identity Recovery

### Social Recovery

Integra supports **social recovery** for identity:

**Setup:**
1. User designates trusted guardians
2. Guardians can collectively recover account
3. Threshold-based approval (e.g., 3-of-5)

**Recovery Process:**
```solidity
// User lost access to private key
// Guardians initiate recovery
socialRecovery.initiateRecovery(
  lostIdentity,
  newIdentity,
  guardianSignatures
);

// After timelock, recovery completes
// All attestations transfer to new identity
```

### Hardware Security

**Best Practices:**
- Use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) for root identity
- Separate signing keys for daily operations
- Multi-sig for organizational identities
- Regular key rotation for operational keys

## Identity Standards

Integra integrates with established standards:

### Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)

- On-chain and off-chain attestations
- Composable with other EAS integrations
- Rich schema support
- Revocation mechanisms

### Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

```
did:ethr:0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
```

- W3C standard
- Resolvable to DID documents
- Support for multiple verification methods
- Interoperable across systems

### Verifiable Credentials

- JSON-LD format
- Cryptographically signed
- Selective disclosure
- Zero-knowledge proof compatible

## Identity Management Best Practices

### For Individuals

1. **Secure Your Root Identity**
   - Use hardware wallet
   - Enable social recovery
   - Never share private keys

2. **Control Your Attestations**
   - Request attestations from trusted parties
   - Revoke outdated attestations
   - Use selective disclosure

3. **Build Reputation Gradually**
   - Start with small contracts
   - Deliver quality work
   - Collect attestations

### For Organizations

1. **Use Multi-Signature Wallets**
   - Prevent single point of failure
   - Require multiple approvers
   - Enable key rotation

2. **Verify Authorized Signers**
   - Attest to authorized representatives
   - Update attestations when staff changes
   - Maintain clear delegation structure

3. **Maintain Corporate Records**
   - Keep business registration current
   - Update operating licenses
   - Attest to compliance credentials

## Technical Implementation

### Creating a Root Identity

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Generate new identity
const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom();
const rootIdentity = wallet.address;

// Or use existing wallet
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey);
```

### Attesting to Identity

```typescript
import { EAS } from '@ethereum-attestation-service/eas-sdk';

const eas = new EAS(EAS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

// Create identity attestation
const attestation = await eas.attest({
  schema: IDENTITY_SCHEMA_UID,
  data: {
    recipient: userAddress,
    expirationTime: 0, // No expiration
    revocable: true,
    data: {
      name: "Alice Smith",
      credentialType: "professional",
      issuer: "acme-corp.eth"
    }
  }
});
```

### Verifying Identity

```typescript
// Verify attestation exists and is valid
const attestation = await eas.getAttestation(attestationUID);

if (!attestation.revoked && attestation.expirationTime > Date.now()) {
  // Attestation is valid
  const identityData = decodeAttestationData(attestation.data);
}
```
