# Integra Architecture Overview

## Real World Contracts (RWC) vs Real World Assets (RWA)

While the blockchain industry has focused heavily on **Real World Assets (RWA)** - tokenizing physical assets like real estate, commodities, and securities - Integra introduces a fundamentally different paradigm: **Real World Contracts (RWC)**.

### Understanding RWA (Real World Assets)

**Real World Assets** are physical or financial assets—like real estate, bonds, and gold—tokenized as digital tokens on blockchain. The RWA process:

1. **Legal structuring** - Asset placed in SPV with regulated custodians
2. **Asset custody** - Physical asset held by licensed custodian
3. **Data verification** - Oracles feed real-world data onto blockchain
4. **Token issuance** - Smart contracts mint tokens representing ownership
5. **Trading** - Tokenized asset traded on secondary markets

**RWA Focus:** Representing *ownership* of physical/financial assets

**RWA Challenges:**
- Requires centralized custodians
- Relies on legal enforceability
- Depends on oracles for valuation
- Limited to high-value assets
- Complex regulatory compliance

### The RWC Paradigm Shift

**Real World Contracts** focus on representing *agreements and relationships* rather than assets.

**RWC vs RWA:**

| Aspect | RWA (Assets) | RWC (Contracts) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **What's Tokenized** | Physical/financial assets | Legal agreements & relationships |
| **Primary Value** | Asset ownership | Credential & reputation |
| **Custodian Need** | Required (physical assets) | Minimal (documents are digital) |
| **Oracle Dependency** | High (asset valuation) | Low (cryptographic proof) |
| **Privacy** | Often public (ownership records) | Privacy-preserving (selective disclosure) |
| **Accessibility** | Limited to high-value assets | Any agreement, any value |
| **Network Effects** | Limited | Strong (reputation builds) |
| **Use Cases** | Investment, trading | Professional credentials, trust graphs |

**RWC Focus:** Documenting *what you've agreed to* and *who you've worked with*

### Why RWC Matters

Contracts are the foundation of business relationships:
- Employment agreements
- Service contracts
- Partnership agreements
- NDAs and confidentiality agreements
- Purchase orders and invoices
- Licensing agreements
- Insurance policies

By bringing these contracts on-chain with proper identity, privacy, and security guarantees, we enable:
- **Verifiable credentials** - Prove your professional history without revealing sensitive details
- **Trust networks** - Build reputation through attestations from contract counterparties
- **Automated compliance** - Smart contracts that enforce real-world legal agreements
- **Privacy-preserving verification** - Prove you have a credential without revealing the credential itself

## Core Principles

Integra is built on four foundational principles that guide every architectural decision:

### 1. Identity

[Learn more about Identity →](./identity)

Digital identity must be:
- **Persistent** - Stable across platforms and time
- **Self-sovereign** - Controlled by the individual or entity
- **Verifiable** - Cryptographically provable
- **Portable** - Usable across different systems

Integra uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to create a robust identity layer that doesn't rely on centralized authorities.

### 2. Trust

[Learn more about Trust →](./trust)

Trust in the system is established through:
- **Cryptographic proofs** - Mathematical certainty over institutional promises
- **Social attestations** - Network effects of verified relationships
- **Reputation graphs** - Historical record of successful collaborations
- **Progressive disclosure** - Reveal only what's necessary

The trust layer enables parties to transact confidently without requiring traditional intermediaries.

### 3. Privacy

[Learn more about Privacy →](./privacy)

Privacy is not optional - it's essential:
- **Selective disclosure** - Share only what's needed
- **Off-chain storage** - Keep sensitive data off public ledgers
- **Access control** - Cryptographically enforced permissions
- **Unlinkability** - Prevent correlation attacks

Integra uses attestations and access control to prove credentials without revealing underlying documents.

### 4. Security

[Learn more about Security →](./security)

Security encompasses:
- **Cryptographic security** - Industry-standard encryption and signing
- **Operational security** - Safe key management and access patterns
- **Economic security** - Resistance to Sybil and spam attacks
- **Legal security** - Compliance with regulations

## Architectural Layers

Integra's architecture consists of five distinct but interoperable layers:

### Layer 1: Foundational Document Identity

[Learn more about Document Identity →](./document-identity)

The base layer establishes unique, verifiable identifiers for real-world documents.

**Key Features:**
- Content-addressable hashing
- Immutable registration timestamps
- Document metadata and versioning
- Namespace precedents for organization

**Implementation:**
- `IntegraLedgerV4_5` smart contract
- IPFS/Arweave for document storage
- SHA-256 + keccak256 for document hashing

### Layer 2: Tokenization Layer

[Learn more about Tokenization →](./tokenization)

Binds ERC token standards to real-world contracts, enabling:

**Token Types:**
- **ERC-721** - Unique contracts (employment agreements, one-off deals)
- **ERC-1155** - Multi-edition contracts (template agreements, subscription services)
- **Fractional ownership** - Shared contract rights

**Use Cases:**
- Transfer contract rights
- Proof of contract existence
- Revenue sharing from contracts
- Secondary markets for contract positions

### Layer 3: Resolver Layer

[Learn more about Resolvers →](./resolvers)

Binds custom smart contracts to real-world contracts for programmability.

**Capabilities:**
- Automated payment releases upon contract milestones
- Multi-signature approvals for contract modifications
- Time-locked access to contract terms
- Conditional execution based on external events

**Integration:**
- Custom resolver contracts per use case
- `IntegraPaymentV4_5` for payment automation
- `IntegraVerifierRegistryV4_5` for access control

### Layer 4: Communication Layer

[Learn more about Communication →](./communication)

Enables secure, attestable communication between contract parties.

**Components:**

**IntegraMessage:**
- Encrypted on-chain messaging
- Thread and conversation management
- Message attestations
- Access-controlled delivery

**IntegraSignal:**
- Cross-chain event signaling
- State synchronization
- Message routing
- Real-time notifications

### Layer 5: EAS/Attestation Layer

[Learn more about Attestations →](./attestations)

The attestation layer provides verifiable claims without revealing underlying data.

**Attestation Types:**

**1. Root Identity Attestations**
- Individual identity verification
- Organizational identity
- Professional credentials
- Educational qualifications

**2. Access Permission Attestations**
- Document access rights (avoids on-chain PII storage)
- Role-based permissions
- Temporary access grants
- Revocable credentials

**3. Social Trust Graph Attestations**
- Contract participation proof (without revealing contract details)
- Professional reputation
- Successful collaboration history
- Network effects of verified relationships

**Privacy Benefits:**
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** - Prove you have a credential without revealing it
- **Selective disclosure** - Share only necessary information
- **Unlinkability** - Prevent correlation across contexts
- **Revocability** - Invalidate compromised credentials

## How the Layers Work Together

### Example: Employment Contract

1. **Document Identity Layer**: Employment agreement is hashed and registered on-chain
2. **Tokenization Layer**: ERC-721 token minted representing the unique employment relationship
3. **Resolver Layer**: Smart contract automates monthly salary payments
4. **Communication Layer**: Employer and employee communicate via IntegraMessage about performance reviews
5. **Attestation Layer**:
   - Employer attests to employee's skills
   - Employee can prove employment without revealing salary
   - After employment ends, attestation serves as verifiable credential

### Example: Service Agreement

1. **Document Identity Layer**: Service contract registered with milestone definitions
2. **Tokenization Layer**: ERC-1155 tokens represent deliverables
3. **Resolver Layer**: Payment released automatically upon milestone attestation
4. **Communication Layer**: Client and vendor coordinate via IntegraSignal for milestone approvals
5. **Attestation Layer**:
   - Client attests to vendor's quality of work
   - Vendor proves successful project completion to future clients
   - Both parties build reputation in their respective networks
