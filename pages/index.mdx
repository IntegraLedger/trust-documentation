# Integra Trust Platform Documentation

Welcome to the Integra Trust Platform documentation. This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of the platform, from architecture to observability.

## What is Integra?

Integra is a blockchain-based document registry and verification platform that enables:

- **Immutable Document Registration** - Register documents on the blockchain with cryptographic proof
- **Token-Based Ownership** - Manage document ownership using ERC-1155 tokens
