# Register a Document

Learn how to register documents on the Integra Trust Platform.

## What is Document Registration?

Document registration creates a permanent, immutable record of your document on the blockchain. The platform:
1. Generates a cryptographic hash of your document
2. Stores the hash on the blockchain
3. Creates a verifiable proof of existence at a specific time

**Important**: Your actual document is NOT uploaded to the blockchain - only its cryptographic fingerprint (hash).

## How to Register a Document

### Step 1: Navigate to Register

1. Log in to your Integra account
2. Click "Register" in the navigation menu
3. You'll see the document upload interface

### Step 2: Upload Your Document

1. Click "Choose File" or drag and drop your document
2. Supported formats:
   - PDF documents
   - Images (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
   - Text files
   - Other common document types

### Step 3: Add Document Details

Provide information about your document:

- **Document Title** (required) - A descriptive name for your document
- **Description** (optional) - Additional context or notes
- **Tags** (optional) - Keywords for easier searching
- **Category** (optional) - Document type (contract, certificate, etc.)

### Step 4: Review and Confirm

1. Review the document details
2. Check the preview (if available)
3. Click "Register Document"

### Step 5: Blockchain Confirmation

1. The system generates a cryptographic hash
2. The hash is submitted to the blockchain
3. Wait for blockchain confirmation (usually 30-60 seconds)
4. You'll receive a confirmation with:
   - Registration ID
   - Blockchain transaction hash
   - Timestamp

## What Happens After Registration?

Once registered, you can:
- **Share the verification link** with others
- **Download a certificate** of registration
- **View the blockchain record** for transparency
- **Update metadata** (but not the document itself)

## Best Practices

### Document Naming
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Include version numbers if applicable
- Be consistent with naming conventions

### Categories and Tags
- Use consistent categories across similar documents
- Add relevant tags for easier searching
- Consider future search needs

### Privacy Considerations
- Remember that metadata is stored on-chain
- Don't include sensitive information in titles or descriptions
- Use generic descriptions for confidential documents

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails
- Check file size (max 10MB typically)
- Ensure file format is supported
- Try a different browser

### Blockchain Confirmation Timeout
- Network congestion can cause delays
- Wait a few minutes and refresh
- Check transaction status on blockchain explorer
